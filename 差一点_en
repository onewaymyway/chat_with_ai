将以下的歌翻译成英语，同时要保持适合rap的风格：差一点

[Verse 1]
我看清了，那“差一点”的假象，像模糊的幻影在眼前晃荡
差一点考上，我梦寐以求的学堂，以为就几分之遥，就能去理想的港
却忘了那几分背后，是千万人海的波浪，是无数个日夜，汗水和泪水的较量
看上去不一样的校章，撕裂了两种人生，未来像断裂的篇章
差一点和她牵手，走到地老天荒，以为只缺一点勇气，就能把爱点亮
却忘了两个人之间，也许根本不搭，像南辕北辙，找不到共同的方向
那些小小的矛盾，堆积成高墙，三观的差异，把所有的美好都埋葬

[Chorus]
我受够了，这该死的“差一点”！像慢性毒药，侵蚀我的信念
它让我停滞不前，在原地打转，看不清真相，活在虚假的边缘
我撕破了，这“差一点”的谎言！它不是距离，是本质的深渊
只有把问题看穿，把根本改变，才能真正超越，不再重演

[Verse 2]
差一点拿到Offer，以为只差一次面试，没发挥好，就错失了良机
却忘了简历筛选时，我可能就已落后，像被剪掉翅膀的飞鸟，还未起飞就已倒
那几句话没说好，暴露出我对公司业务的浅薄，对企业文化的无知，像个盲人摸象的拙劣表演
差一点赶上末班车，以为只是晚了几分钟，抱怨命运不公，却从不反思自身
那几分钟背后，是混乱的时间管理，是规划的漏洞，像一盘散沙，一碰就乱
错过了这趟车，后续的全盘打乱，才知道应急预案的必要，像个亡羊补牢的警钟敲响

[Chorus]
我受够了，这该死的“差一点”！像慢性毒药，侵蚀我的信念
它让我停滞不前，在原地打转，看不清真相，活在虚假的边缘
我撕破了，这“差一点”的谎言！它不是距离，是本质的深渊
只有把问题看穿，把根本改变，才能真正超越，不再重演

[Bridge]
差一点赢得比赛，一个球的差距，像被命运捉弄，不甘心却无力
却忘了对手在整体实力上的压制，像一座无法逾越的山峰，把我牢牢限制
临场发挥失误，暴露出平时训练的不足，心理素质的脆弱，像个纸糊的巨人，一碰就碎
差一点完成目标，以为只是时间不够，拖延症作祟，让计划都落空
却忘了周详的计划，坚决的执行力，才是成功的基石，像一座大厦的根基，不牢固就会坍塌
意外情况频发，是风险评估的缺失，应对能力的薄弱，像个只会抱怨的孩子，永远无法成长

[Verse 3]
差一点避免事故，以为只是疏忽一瞬，却没想过安全意识的淡漠，才是事故的根本原因
小小的操作失误，反映出对规程的漠视，像玩火自焚，最终引火上身
差一点说出口的表白，勇气不足，话语卡在喉咙，像被堵住的河流，无法奔涌
却忘了对方的心意，也许根本不在这里，表白只会带来尴尬，像一场没有观众的独角戏
时机不对，是彼此关系认知不清，更多了解，才是感情的铺垫，像地基不稳的建筑，迟早会倾覆
差一点拿到投资，商业计划书的缺陷，被一眼看穿，像个拙劣的谎言，无法自圆其说
路演表现不佳，是信心不足，表达能力的欠缺，像个哑巴，有话却说不出

[Chorus]
我受够了，这该死的“差一点”！像慢性毒药，侵蚀我的信念
它让我停滞不前，在原地打转，看不清真相，活在虚假的边缘
我撕破了，这“差一点”的谎言！它不是距离，是本质的深渊
只有把问题看穿，把根本改变，才能真正超越，不再重演

[Outro]

**"Almost" (English Rap Version)**

**\[Verse 1]**
I see it now – the illusion of "almost made it"
Like a blurry phantom, swayin’ in my vision, I hate it
Almost got into the school I dreamed for ages
Just a few points away – or so I thought – from the place I craved in pages
But behind those few points is an ocean of faces
Countless nights and days, sweat and tears in races
The crest of a different school badge splits two lives apart
The future ripped like pages, a story with no start

Almost held her hand, walked ‘til the end of time
Thought I just lacked courage to make her heart shine
But forgot between two souls, we might not align
Like heading north and south, no path to combine
Those tiny little fights built up like a wall
Our values never matched – buried the beauty of it all

**\[Chorus]**
I’ve had enough of this damn “almost” lie!
Like slow-drip poison, eats away at my drive
It keeps me stuck in place, spinnin’ in the same spot
Can't see the truth – livin' life in a false plot
I tear apart that "almost" disguise!
It’s not a short gap – it’s a deep divide
Only when I see the cause, change what’s within
Can I rise above – never fall again

**\[Verse 2]**
Almost got the offer – just one last talk
Thought I blew that interview, missed my shot
But forgot in the résumé race, I was already behind
Like a bird with clipped wings – crashed before the climb
Didn’t say the right words, showed my lack of depth
Didn’t know the biz, played blind man’s chess
Didn’t catch the last train – just minutes too slow
Cursed my fate, never asked why I froze

Behind those minutes – chaos in my plan
No time control, like sand slippin’ through my hand
Missed that ride, the dominoes all fell
Should’ve had backup plans, learned that lesson well
Like a warning bell in the night, I heard it sound
A second too late – the world spun around

**\[Chorus]**
I’ve had enough of this damn “almost” lie!
Like slow-drip poison, eats away at my drive
It keeps me stuck in place, spinnin’ in the same spot
Can't see the truth – livin' life in a false plot
I tear apart that "almost" disguise!
It’s not a short gap – it’s a deep divide
Only when I see the cause, change what’s within
Can I rise above – never fall again

**\[Bridge]**
Almost won the game – just a single shot
Like fate played jokes, I gave it all I got
But forgot the other side – their power, their height
A mountain too steep – I never had the might
My nerves cracked under pressure – no solid base
Like a giant made of paper, fallin' flat on my face

Almost hit the goal – blamed time again
But it was my delay, that sunk the plan
Forgot that plans and action lay the ground
Like a tower with no roots – it's comin’ down
Surprises blew it up – risk control was blind
Acted like a kid complainin’, never strengthened the mind

**\[Verse 3]**
Almost dodged the crash – thought it was luck
But safety blind spots is what really messed it up
Tiny slip of hand, showin’ no respect for rules
Playin’ with fire – now I’m the one that’s bruised

Almost said “I love you” – fear sealed my throat
Like a dammed-up river – no current, no hope
But maybe she was never even in the zone
Confessin’ love alone – like actin’ on my own
Wrong time, wrong scene – didn’t read the part
Understanding builds love – like bricks for the heart

Almost got the funding – plan had holes
Exposed in seconds, like lies that unfold
Pitch went bad – no fire in my tone
Like a mute with a message, but no way to be known

**\[Chorus]**
I’ve had enough of this damn “almost” lie!
Like slow-drip poison, eats away at my drive
It keeps me stuck in place, spinnin’ in the same spot
Can't see the truth – livin' life in a false plot
I tear apart that "almost" disguise!
It’s not a short gap – it’s a deep divide
Only when I see the cause, change what’s within
Can I rise above – never fall again

**\[Outro]**
Almost made it
Almost made it

Oh oh oh oh

Almost made it
Almost made it

Oh oh oh oh

song v2:

Almost

[Verse 1]
Man, I’m sick of that “almost” talk,
Close don’t count when the door gets locked.
“Few more points” – nah, miss me with that,
It’s blood, sweat, years – not some lucky stat.

Thought I’d made it, thought I’d win,
But dreams don’t fly when you halfway in.
Tried with her – thought love was near,
But hearts don’t match when the vibe ain’t clear.

Fights got loud, walls got tall,
All that “meant to be” just started to fall.
Truth is rough, yeah, cuts like glass,
“Almost” is a joke – I’m done with the mask.

[Hook]
I’m done with “almost”, that word’s a curse,
Feels like I’m trapped, just makin’ it worse.
Keeps me stuck, just killin' my drive,
Loopin' in lies, not feelin' alive.

Rip that mask – “almost” ain't real,
It ain’t a gap – it's a wound that won’t heal.
I see the game, I’m changin’ the plan,
Ain’t fallin’ again – I’m takin’ a stand.

[Verse 2]
“Almost got hired” – nah, I flopped,
Wasn’t the interview – I was weak from the top.
Resume thin, vibe was off,
Didn’t prep right, now I'm takin’ the loss.

Missed that train – late by a breath,
But it ain’t bad luck – that’s poor time management.
No backup plan, whole thing crashed,
Then I had the nerve to blame it on chance.

Truth is hard, but I took that hit,
Now I build tight – no room for slips.
Every L, I wear that loud,
Better to fall than fake bein’ proud.

[Hook]
I’m done with “almost”, that word’s a curse,
Feels like I’m trapped, just makin’ it worse.
Keeps me stuck, just killin' my drive,
Loopin' in lies, not feelin' alive.

Rip that mask – “almost” ain't real,
It ain’t a gap – it's a wound that won’t heal.
I see the game, I’m changin’ the plan,
Ain’t fallin’ again – I’m takin’ a stand.

[Bridge]
Almost won? Still lost.
One point short – still paid that cost.
Didn’t train right, cracked under heat,
You can’t fake clutch – you fold or compete.

“Ran outta time” – nah, I burned it,
Wasted days, now I’m the one hurtin’.
Excuses loud, but action’s dead,
No more plans just stuck in my head.

[Verse 3]
“Almost safe” – nah, I was careless,
Skipped the rules – now the burn’s just endless.
One small slip, whole thing blows,
Can’t play dumb when the danger shows.

“Almost told her” – nah, I froze,
Scared to speak, now the door's closed.
But maybe she was never down,
I just built dreams that ain't stick to ground.

“Almost raised funds” – plan had cracks,
Pitch was weak, got grilled to ash.
Didn’t believe it, couldn’t sell,
Silent mouth in a story to tell.

[Final Hook]
I’m done with “almost”, that word’s a trap,
Keeps me blind while I’m holdin’ back.
Sick of the stall, I’m breakin’ the chain,
It’s now or never – no halfway game.

Tear that mask – “almost” is fake,
It ain’t a lesson, it’s a life I won’t take.
Fix the roots, flip the script,
No more regrets, I’m done with the glitch.

[Outro – Spoken / Rapped Softly]
Almost made it…
Almost said it…
Almost lived it…
Nah.

Almost don’t count.
Not anymore.
I’m takin’ it all.
Or I’m takin’ the floor.
